# Data Science Blog Post
This is the fourth project "Data Science Blog Post". In this project i've chosen the survey data provided by Stack Overflow.
The survey was taken upon the website member in year 2019. I've started by cleaning up the data and proposed 5 questions.
Through out the code i've analysed, visualaized and communicated my finding for these questions.
the Libraries used are the typical ones: Matplotlib, Pandas, numpy & Seaborn.
Here's the linnk for the article in Medium highlighting my findings:
